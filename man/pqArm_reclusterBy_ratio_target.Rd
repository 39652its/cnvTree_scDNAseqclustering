pqArm_reclusterBy_ratio_target(
  pqArm_cluster,
  Cluster,
  pqReclsut_sim,
  difratio_chr
)
}
\arguments{
\item{pqArm_cluster}{A table recorded the clustering result and pqArm clustering result for each cell. This table recorded the clustering history in each step.}

\item{Cluster}{An integer for the specific cluster to calculate.}

\item{pqReclsut_sim}{A table with columns between whole cluster and each different ratio at bin-level.
Returns the ratio of bin-level differences between each cluster and its most similar cluster in each differing p or q arm.}

\item{difratio_chr}{A numeric value set for criteria of different ratio in the different chromosome.}
}
\value{
A list stored characters stands for clusters to be grouped together.

\title{Compute similarity between pqArm clusters}
\usage{
pqArm_recluster(pqArm_cluster, Cluster)
}
\arguments{
\item{pqArm_cluster}{A data frame recording the pqArm clustering results for each cell, including the clustering history at each step.}

\item{Cluster}{An integer specifying the cluster for which similarity calculations are performed.}
}
\value{
A numeric matrix representing the similarity between pqArm clusters.
The similarity is computed based on the Euclidean distance between pqArm cluster patterns.
}
\description{
This function calculates the similarity between pqArm clusters using
Euclidean distance. The similarity matrix quantifies the differences
in arm-level copy number variation (CNV) patterns across clusters.

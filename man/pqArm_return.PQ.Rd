\title{Identify differences in p/q arm positions between chromosome clusters}
\usage{
pqArm_return.PQ(pattern, PQarm)
}
\arguments{
\item{pattern}{A data frame with two columns representing paired CNV patterns.
Each row corresponds to a specific chromosome region comparison.}

\item{PQarm}{A character vector specifying the chromosome order list.}
}
\value{
A character vector indicating the chromosome arms (\code{p} or \code{q})
that show differences between the two clusters.
}
\description{
This function detects differences in the p or q arm positions of chromosomes
between two clusters based on copy number variation (CNV) patterns.

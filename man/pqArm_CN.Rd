\title{Smooth copy number matrix using arm-level ranges}
\usage{
pqArm_CN(input, Cluster_label, Clustering_output, pqArm_file)
}
\arguments{
\item{input}{A named list where each element is a \code{GRanges} object representing a single cell.}

\item{Cluster_label}{An integer specifying the cluster for which the copy number smoothing is performed.}

\item{Clustering_output}{A data frame recording the clustering results for each cell,
including the clustering history at each step.}

\item{pqArm_file}{A data frame containing cytoband information, representing p/q arm-level
chromosome regions based on Giemsa-stained cytogenetic data.}
}
\value{
A matrix with smoothed copy number states (Deletion, Neutral, or Amplification)
at the arm level across chromosomes.
}
\description{
This function processes single-cell copy number data by smoothing
copy number variations (CNVs) at the arm level. It utilizes clustering results
and cytoband information to assign copy number states (Deletion, Neutral, or Amplification)
for each chromosomal arm.

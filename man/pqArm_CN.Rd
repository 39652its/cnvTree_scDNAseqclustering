\title{Smooth copy number matrix using arm-level ranges}
\usage{
pqArm_CN(input, Cluster_label, Clustering_output, pqArm_file)
}
\arguments{
\item{input}{A named list where each element is a \code{GRanges} object representing a single cell.}

\item{Cluster_label}{An integer specifying the cluster for which the copy number smoothing is performed.}

\item{Clustering_output}{A data frame recording the clustering results for each cell,
including the clustering history at each step.}

\item{pqArm_file}{In-build cytoband template for selection: \code{hg38}, \code{hg19}, \code{mm10}, \code{mm39}.
Or a filepath of a table for cytoband information seen on Giemsa-stained chromosomes.
It should include the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{chrom}: Reference sequence chromosome or scaffold.
\item \code{chromStart}: Start position in genoSeq.
\item \code{chromEnd}: End position in genoSeq.
\item \code{name}: Name of cytogenetic band.
\item \code{gieStain}: Giemsa stain results.
}}
}
\value{
A matrix with smoothed copy number states (Deletion, Neutral, or Amplification)
at the arm level across chromosomes.
}
\description{
This function processes single-cell copy number data by smoothing
copy number variations (CNVs) at the arm level. It utilizes clustering results
and cytoband information to assign copy number states (Deletion, Neutral, or Amplification)
for each chromosomal arm.

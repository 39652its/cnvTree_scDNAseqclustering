\title{Define copy number variation hotspots based on significant breakpoints}
\usage{
bp_events(input, Template, binsize)
}
\arguments{
\item{input}{A named list where each element is a \code{GRanges} object representing a single cell.}

\item{Template}{A data frame recording significant breakpoints with the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{chr}: Chromosome name (chr1, chr2, ...).
\item \code{site}: Breakpoint position.
\item \code{times}: The frequency of breakpoint occurrence.
\item \code{events}: Number of distinct breakpoint events.
\item \code{cover_nums}: Number of breakpoints covered within the specified range.
\item \code{cover_times}: Number of times a breakpoint is covered.
\item \code{binsize}: Fixed-bin size used in the calculation.
}}

\item{binsize}{An integer specifying the fixed-bin size, referring to the copy number
variation calling result where the genomic region is split into bins.}
}
\value{
A data frame listing CNV events for each chromosome, identifying regions where copy number variations frequently occur.
}
\description{
This function identifies genomic regions where copy number variations (CNVs)
frequently occur, based on a list of significant breakpoints.

\title{Output the bin-level copy number sequence in different p or q arm chromosome}
\usage{
pqArm_return.Bins(Pattern, which_Arm, Tem, CN_matrix)
}
\arguments{
\item{Pattern}{A string with integers from each chromosome p and q arm copy number values combine with "_".}

\item{which_Arm}{A vector stands for the different p or q arm in chromosome between two clusters.}

\item{Tem}{A table recorded the clustering result and pqArm clustering result for each cell. This table recorded the clustering history in each step.}

\item{CN_matrix}{A integer matrix, which column names are selected cellIDs and row names are genome ranges separated in fixed bins.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector which each element stands for a mode value in each bin of a cluster of cells.
}

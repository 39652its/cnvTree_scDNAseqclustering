\title{Extract bin-level copy number sequence in differentiated chromosome arms}
\usage{
pqArm_return.Bins(Pattern, which_Arm, Tem, CN_matrix)
}
\arguments{
\item{Pattern}{A character string encoding copy number values for each chromosome p/q arm,
with values concatenated using \verb{_}.}

\item{which_Arm}{A character vector specifying the chromosome arms (\code{p} or \code{q})
that differ between the two clusters.}

\item{Tem}{A data frame recording the clustering history for each cell, including
overall clustering results and p/q arm-specific clustering assignments.}

\item{CN_matrix}{An integer matrix where:
\itemize{
\item Columns represent the \code{cellID}s of the specific cells.
\item Rows represent genomic regions, divided into fixed bins.
}}
}
\value{
A numeric vector where each element represents the mode copy number value
for a given bin within a cluster of cells.
}
\description{
This function retrieves the bin-level copy number sequence for chromosome p/q arms
that show differences between two clusters.

\title{Compute bin-level difference ratios between pqArm clusters}
\usage{
pqArm_reclustering_dif(
  input,
  pqArm_recluster_sim,
  pqArm_cluster,
  Cluster,
  pqArm_file
)
}
\arguments{
\item{input}{A named list where each element is a \code{GRanges} object representing a single cell.}

\item{pqArm_recluster_sim}{A numeric matrix recording the similarity between pqArm clusters.}

\item{pqArm_cluster}{A data frame recording the pqArm clustering history for each cell.}

\item{Cluster}{An integer specifying the cluster for which the bin-level
difference ratio is computed.}

\item{pqArm_file}{A data frame containing cytoband information observed on Giemsa-stained chromosomes.}
}
\value{
A data frame summarizing bin-level difference ratios across clusters.
The output includes:
\itemize{
\item \verb{cluster"}: The cluster identifier.
\item \code{pqArm}: The differing p or q arm.
\item \code{bin_difference_ratio}: The ratio of bin-level differences between each cluster and its most similar cluster.
}
}
\description{
This function calculates the bin-level difference ratios between different
pqArm clusters. The ratio represents the degree of difference in copy number
variations (CNVs) between each cluster and its most similar cluster,
considering variations at the p and q arms.

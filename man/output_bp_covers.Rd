\title{Identify significant breakpoints based on coverage in a specified range}
\usage{
output_bp_covers(Template, binsize, overlap, overlap_times)
}
\arguments{
\item{Template}{A data frame containing breakpoint sites with the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{seqnames}: Chromosome name (chr1, chr2, ...).
\item \code{start}: Start position of the breakpoint.
\item \code{end}: End position of the breakpoint.
\item \code{width}: Width of the fixed-bin size in the genomic regions.
\item \code{strand}: Strand information (\code{+} or \code{-}).
\item \code{copy.number}: Left copy number value at the breakpoint.
\item \code{cellID}: Identifier of the corresponding cell.
}}

\item{binsize}{An integer specifying the fixed-bin size, referring to the copy number
variation calling result where the genomic region is split into bins.}

\item{overlap}{An integer defining the copy number frequently changed regions.}

\item{overlap_times}{A numeric value used as a filtering criterion for significant breakpoints in event region calculation.
The default value is set as half the number of cells in the cluster.}
}
\value{
A data frame recording significant breakpoints with the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{chr}: Chromosome name (chr1, chr2, ...).
\item \code{site}: Breakpoint position.
\item \code{times}: The frequency of breakpoint occurrence.
\item \code{events}: Number of distinct breakpoint events.
\item \code{cover_nums}: Number of breakpoints covered within the specified range.
\item \code{cover_times}: Number of times a breakpoint is covered.
\item \code{binsize}: Fixed-bin size used in the calculation.
}
}
\description{
This function calculates how many breakpoints can be covered within a specified range
for each breakpoint, treating it as the midpoint. It also filters significant breakpoints
based on a defined threshold.

\title{Construct a phylogenetic tree from copy number variation data}
\usage{
CutTree_final(input, selected)
}
\arguments{
\item{input}{A named list where each element is a \code{GRanges} object representing a single cell.}

\item{selected}{A character vector specifying the \code{cellID}s of the cells to be included in the phylogenetic analysis.}
}
\value{
A data frame with two columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{cellID}: The unique identifier of each cell.
\item \code{cluster}: The assigned cluster label (k = 2).
}
}
\description{
This function performs hierarchical clustering on selected cells based on their copy number variations
and derives a phylogenetic tree structure.

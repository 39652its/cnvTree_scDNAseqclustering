\title{Cluster cells based on arm-level copy number patterns}
\usage{
pqArm_clustering(matrix, Label)
}
\arguments{
\item{matrix}{An integer matrix where columns represent individual cells, and rows correspond
to arm-level copy number regions across chromosomes.}

\item{Label}{An integer specifying the cluster to compute in the arm-level CNV analysis.}
}
\value{
A data frame recording the clustering results for each cell, including
the clustering history at each step.

A table recorded the clustering result for each cell. This table recorded the clustering history in each step.
}
\description{
This function performs clustering on cells using arm-level copy number variations (CNVs).
It groups cells into clusters based on chromosomal arm-level CNV profiles, providing
a hierarchical clustering history at each step.

\title{Compute Euclidean distance between two vectors}
\usage{
euclidean(a, b)
}
\arguments{
\item{a}{A numeric vector of the same length as \code{b}.}

\item{b}{A numeric vector of the same length as \code{a}.}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing the Euclidean distance between the two vectors.
}
\description{
This function calculates the Euclidean distance (Lâ‚‚ norm) between two numeric vectors.
The Euclidean distance is computed as:
\deqn{\sqrt{\sum (a_i - b_i)^2}}
}

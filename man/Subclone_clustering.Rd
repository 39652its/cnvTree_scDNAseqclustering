\title{Perform subclone clustering based on copy number patterns}
\usage{
Subclone_clustering(CN_incells_input, event_region, dif_ratio, Subclone_num)
}
\arguments{
\item{CN_incells_input}{A numeric data frame where each column corresponds to a cell,
and each row maps to a chromosome segment from the segment template.}

\item{event_region}{A data frame containing continuous bin-level chromosome segments,
divided by event region templates.}

\item{dif_ratio}{A numeric value specifying the tolerance threshold for differences
in copy number patterns between cells during clustering.}

\item{Subclone_num}{An integer used as the index for the subclone.}
}
\value{
A data frame recording the final result of subclone clustering, containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{Subclone}: The subclone identifier.
\item \code{cellID}: The unique identifier for each cell.
\item \code{Subclone_cellnum}: The number of cells in each subclone.
}
}
\description{
This function performs subclone clustering by analyzing copy number patterns in predefined chromosome segment templates.
It groups cells into subclones by comparing copy number variations (CNVs) while tolerating a specified level
of difference between cells.
